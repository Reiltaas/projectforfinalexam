# Project For Final Exam
Final project still in process
1. still need to add the functions of contacts but overall the code works 
2. file handling i personally want to add a sorting function but that can wait
3. need to give more description on the code for other friends
4. still trying to find out how to make the file type a txt file without breaking anything



Description of the code:
this code is a police contacts code where we have 3 types of mode
admin, police and user:
admin:
1. they have the abbility to edit and delete accounts for both the user and police
2. they have the ability to edit contacts and delete them
3. they can view contacts and account
   a. for account you can view them depending on what you want either user or police account

police:
1. they can view contacts that are registered in the files and they can add their own contacts
2. register and login function are available here they can also change their password

user:
1. they can only view contacts either for specific division (maybe) or all
2. register and login function are the same as in police
